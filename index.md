# About Me

<!-- basic background -->

Hello! My name is Matt. I'm currently a PhD student in physics at [Brandeis University](https://brandeis.edu), where I am co-advised by [Aparna Baskaran](https://www.brandeis.edu/physics/people/profiles/baskaran-aparna.html) and [Michael Hagan](https://www.brandeis.edu/physics/people/profiles/hagan-michael.html). My research falls under the broad category of [active matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_matter)â€”more specifically, I study the effects of confinement on the non-equilibrium behavior of active filaments through a combination of theory, simulation, and close collaboration with experimentalists.

Most of my day-to-day work involves programming to some degree; usually simple one-off bash scripts or data analysis tools. I've developed a love for programming as a result, and spend a lot of time thinking about how to build tools or libraries that could make my life (and maybe the lives of others?) easier. Mostly, these tools are related to the research I do, but when I have time I like to explore other projects ([like this NES emulator](https://github.com/mattsep/renes)).

<!-- Outside of science and programming, I'm an avid guitarist, and enjoy various board and video games. -->
